3. Works only on a YouTube video page, by detecting if you are currently on one.

## How to use:

2. Go to [Your chrome extensions dashboard](chrome://extensions/)
3. Enable "Developer mode" by toggling the switch on the top right corner of the page
4. Click on the "Load unpacked" button, select the folder containing your unpacked extension (the cloned repo), and click on "Select Folder."
5. Once the folder has been successfully loaded to your dashboard, enable it.
6. Refresh the extension, just in case.
7. And tada! you can now store the timestamps of your videos on the go.

## Scope for improvement:
- Enhance UI.
- Add labels to the timestamps.
